This website uses <a href="https://astro.build" title="Astro.js">Astro.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" title="TailwindCSS">Tailwind CSS</a>!
I must admit things like this are not first-nature to me, but thanks to the beauty of YouTube, reading the docs, and how-to guides, I was able to come up with this site. I hope to learn more as I continue experimenting!

It may be simple, but it is still quite fun to work with!

That is all for now.. take care!
